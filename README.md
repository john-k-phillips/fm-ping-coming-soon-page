<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Submit their email address using an input field
- [ ] Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - [ ] The input field is empty
  - [ ] The email address is not formatted correctly

  <img alt="Vite" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Vite-ffd32b?style=flat-square&logo=vite&logoColor=black" />
</p>
<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    This project I spent the time to learn how to add TailwindCSS with postcss. I also used vite to handle then processing of the two files.
    I intended on learning how to implement TailwindCSS so this was a successful outcome despite the pages design.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    This project will definitely require a revisit in the future. When I'm more comfortable with the tools I had used.
